# As of 2024/03 -- OSX basically never had qt builds. If somebody asks, we can build them
# As of 2024/03 -- qt6 works better than qt5 on aarch64. So drop qt5.
# As of 2024/03 -- No windows users have expressed concerns about the qt libraries. don't build None
# As of 2024/05 -- We had trouble gettin the aarch64 builds to work well with Qt6 and import cv2 on the CIs.
#                  We can re-consider adding Qt6 support for Aarch upon request.
