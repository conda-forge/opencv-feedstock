# This recipe creates 3 packages
# libopencv, py-opencv, opencv
#
# libopencv actually contains all the files, including the site-packages
# file needed to run opencv with python.
#     opencv-dnn seems to change on every patch version, therefore, we pin
#     to the patch version x.x.x
#
# py-opencv is a meta package that constrains the python dependencies
#     This one is pinned to the minor version. x.x
#
# opencv is a backward compatible package, with no pinnings
#
# This approach is different than the one in defaults. Default's package
# seperates well the files generated with python dependencies, from those
# generated without. Unfortunately, this isn't entirely supported by
# upstream. Their hacks are quite elaborate, making it seem difficult to
# maintain as opencv has been changing their build system recently.
#
# By putting all the generated files in 1 package, this makes the build process
# much easier, at the expense of a few MBs in the 'lib' package.
